# PRD And Feature Management

## Purpose
- Define how PRDs and feature plans are created, approved, updated, and traced during harness-driven work.
- Keep planning artifacts strict enough that later spec, build, evaluator, and fix loops can reference them without guesswork.
- Separate product-boundary decisions from per-feature implementation loops.

## Ownership
- This document owns rules.
- Use it to understand what PRDs and features are, what they must contain, what may remain open, what must be clear before approval, and how traceability and change control work.
- It does not own the full step-by-step baton sequence.
- In a consuming repo, use `docs/agents/workflow.md` for the ordered flow, pause points, and handoff timing between planning and execution.

## Planning Layers
- In a consuming repo, `docs/plans/prd/` owns bounded PRD documents.
- In a consuming repo, `docs/plans/feature/` owns loop-sized feature documents derived from approved PRDs.
- In a consuming repo, `docs/plans/spec/` owns implementation-facing specs derived from approved features.
- In a consuming repo, `docs/policies/` continues to own durable project rules and contracts.

## Core Model
- A `PRD` is the upper planning boundary for one coherent product increment.
- A `Feature` is the execution unit for one harness loop target.
- A harness run should always be traceable back to exactly one feature plan.
- Every feature plan should trace back to exactly one parent PRD.

## Feature Types

Not every feature serves the same role in the harness workflow.

### Product Feature
- Purpose:
  - deliver a user-visible outcome
- Requirement:
  - must define clear user-visible behavior
  - must be evaluable through interaction, presentation, or user-observable state
- Examples:
  - authentication entry screen
  - display mode toggle

### Foundation Feature
- Purpose:
  - remove downstream ambiguity by fixing a contract, invariant, or ownership boundary
- Requirement:
  - must not rely on vague prep-work framing
  - must resolve one concrete contract or system-level ambiguity that later features depend on
- Allowed outcomes:
  - data ownership fixed
  - value shape fixed
  - fallback rule fixed
  - state model fixed
- Examples:
  - media metadata contract
  - session schema normalization

## Why This Split Exists
- PRDs define direction, scope, exclusions, and acceptance envelope.
- Feature plans define loop-sized implementation targets, dependencies, and pass or fail checks.
- Scope changes belong in the PRD layer, not inside evaluator feedback or implementation notes.

## Creation Flow
1. Gather the user request and golden sources.
2. Run `PRD Normalizer` and write or update a PRD document.
3. Stop and review the PRD with the human owner.
4. Resolve unclear points, exclusions, and uncertainty until the PRD boundary is acceptable.
5. Mark the PRD as `approved`.
6. Run `Feature Planner` against the approved PRD.
7. Stop and review the proposed feature boundaries with the human owner.
8. Split, merge, defer, or reject features until the boundary is acceptable.
9. Mark the chosen feature documents as `approved`.
10. Run spec, build, evaluate, and fix loops against a single approved feature document at a time.

## PRD Rules
- Create a new PRD when the requested increment introduces a new upper scope boundary.
- Update an existing PRD when the request is still part of the same bounded increment.
- Human intervention is expected and desirable while a PRD is still `draft`.
- A `draft` PRD may be questioned, narrowed, expanded, corrected, or restructured before approval.
- A PRD may retain bounded open questions or uncertainty as long as they are explicitly recorded and do not make the upper scope boundary unusable.
- Ask the human owner direct clarification questions when unresolved PRD ambiguity would materially change the upper scope boundary, exclusions, or candidate feature direction.
- Do not treat PRD output as executable truth until the human owner accepts the boundary.
- A PRD must explicitly define:
  - request summary
  - source set
  - confirmed scope
  - excluded scope
  - uncertainty
  - constraints
  - acceptance envelope
  - proposed feature candidates
- A PRD must not contain implementation steps, code tasks, or evaluator reports.

## PRD Open Item Versus Foundation Feature

- Keep an item in the PRD when it is still an open question or unresolved planning ambiguity.
- Create a foundation feature when the intended direction is chosen and now needs a bounded, traceable contract artifact.
- Move the rule into the consuming repo's `docs/policies/` instead when it becomes a durable repo-wide rule rather than a request-local planning outcome.

## Feature Rules
- Create one feature document for each loop-sized unit approved from a PRD.
- Human intervention is expected and desirable while feature boundaries are still being proposed.
- Proposed features may be split, merged, reordered, deferred, or rejected before approval.
- Every feature should declare a `Type` of `product` or `foundation`.
- A foundation feature must produce one concrete contract or invariant, not a vague preparation step.
- A product feature should not absorb unresolved contract questions that belong in a foundation feature.
- An approved feature must be concrete enough to hand off to the spec agent without guesswork about scope, dependencies, user-visible outcome, data ownership, interaction behavior, or pass/fail checks.
- If unclear, open, or weakly supported points remain in a feature boundary, ask the human owner direct clarification questions until the execution target is clear enough to approve.
- Do not start spec or implementation work from a feature document that has not been boundary-locked.
- A product feature must have one clear user-visible outcome.
- A foundation feature must have one clear system-level contract outcome.
- A feature must be small enough to converge in one to three build or fix loops in normal cases.
- A feature must explicitly define:
  - parent PRD
  - scope boundary
  - dependencies
  - pass or fail checks
  - regression surfaces
  - harness-trace fields
- A feature must not silently absorb missing scope discovered later.

## Status Model
Use these statuses for PRD and feature documents:

- `draft`: being prepared and not yet approved for downstream use
- `approved`: boundary accepted and ready for downstream planning or execution
- `in-loop`: currently being used by spec, build, evaluate, or fix work
- `blocked`: cannot proceed because of an unresolved dependency or decision
- `passed`: execution target satisfied and accepted
- `superseded`: replaced by a newer document or narrower split

## Change Control
- If evaluator output reveals a missing but desirable behavior:
  - do not silently implement it
  - decide whether it belongs in the parent PRD or the current feature
  - update the planning document first
- If a PRD or feature changes materially enough that its current filename becomes misleading:
  - rename the file when the ID should remain the same and the boundary is still the same planning object
  - create a new PRD or feature and mark the old one `superseded` when the boundary itself has changed into a different planning object
  - do not leave an active planning artifact with a semantically false filename
- If a feature grows beyond a stable loop size:
  - split it into new feature documents
  - mark the old feature as `superseded`
- If a change alters the upper scope boundary:
  - update the PRD first
  - then re-check linked feature documents

## Human Review Rights
- The human owner may interrupt and revise planning output at any time before PRD approval.
- The human owner may interrupt and revise feature boundaries at any time before feature approval.
- Questions, objections, and clarifications should be resolved in the planning layer instead of being pushed into spec or implementation.
- After approval, scope changes must return to the planning layer instead of being absorbed ad hoc during execution.

## Clarification Rule
- A PRD may be approved with explicitly recorded open items when those items do not block safe feature planning.
- Do not approve a feature boundary while material ambiguity remains.
- If the next planning or execution step depends on an unclear point, stop and ask the human owner.
- Prefer a short direct question over silent assumption when the ambiguity could change scope, dependency order, data ownership, interaction behavior, or acceptance checks.

## Feature Approval Rule Extension

- A product feature must not be approved for spec handoff if a required foundation feature is unresolved.
- A foundation feature may be approved only when:
  - ambiguity is eliminated enough for downstream spec to proceed without guessing
  - ownership and dependency questions are no longer open
- A product feature may enter spec generation only after its required foundation features are `approved`.
- A product feature should enter build only after its required foundation features are `passed` when the dependency affects data shape, ownership, or acceptance logic.

## Traceability Rules
- Every PRD should have a stable ID such as `prd-0001`.
- Every feature should have a stable ID such as `feat-0001`.
- Every spec should have a stable ID such as `spec-0001`.
- Feature documents must link to their parent PRD by path and ID.
- Spec documents should link to exactly one parent feature and one parent PRD by path and ID.
- Harness runs, evaluator reports, or fix notes should reference the active feature ID.
- When a document is revised materially, add a short dated continuity note instead of rewriting history invisibly.

## Evaluator Behavior By Feature Type

- For product features:
  - validate user-visible behavior, interaction, layout, state transitions, and regression
- For foundation features:
  - validate contract completeness
  - validate absence of blocking ambiguity
  - validate readiness for spec handoff
- Evaluators must not:
  - invent missing behavior
  - silently upgrade uncertainty into confirmed scope

## Naming Guidance
- Use filenames in the form `prd-####-slug.md` and `feat-####-slug.md`.
- Keep slugs short and outcome-focused.
- Prefer stable IDs over conversational filenames.

## Minimal Operating Pattern
- One PRD can yield several feature documents.
- Only one feature should normally be `in-loop` at a time unless the user explicitly wants parallel execution.
- Previous passed features become regression surfaces for later features.

## Split Trigger For Product Features

Split a product feature when one or more of these become true:
- multiple presentation modes require substantially different structure
- fallback behavior diverges by surface
- evaluator failures cluster into different UI surfaces
- the feature repeatedly fails to converge within one to three loops

## Relationship To Agent Roles
- In a consuming repo, `docs/agents/prd-normalizer.md` defines how to stabilize raw inputs into a bounded PRD.
- In a consuming repo, `docs/agents/feature-planner.md` defines how to decompose an approved PRD into loop-sized features.
- In a consuming repo, `docs/agents/spec-agent.md` defines how to convert one approved feature into a build-ready spec.
- In a consuming repo, `docs/policies/harness/execution-loop-governance.md` defines how approved features move through execution loops and how failures route upward.
- This guide defines where those outputs live and how they stay traceable over time.
