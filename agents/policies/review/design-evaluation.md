# Design Evaluation

## Purpose
- Keep reusable design-evaluation assets derived from real review history.
- Preserve concrete evaluator rules that should be applied again in future features.
- Strengthen design review consistency without forcing every rule into the full design constitution.

## Ownership
- This document owns reusable design-evaluation checks and cautions.
- Use [design-evaluator.md](../../agents/design-evaluator.md) for the role contract.
- Use [design-constitution.md](./design-constitution.md) for broader durable design law.
- Use [design-document-governance.md](./design-document-governance.md) for document hierarchy.

## Use
- Apply these notes when evaluating visible implementation work.
- Add new entries when the same class of design failure proves reusable beyond one feature.
- Promote an entry into the constitution only when it becomes a broader product-wide visual law.

## Reusable Evaluation Notes

### 1. Card Content Containment
- Text must not escape card bounds.
- Tags must wrap or truncate without spilling outside the card.
- Metadata and footer content must remain contained inside the card.
- Long titles, dense tags, or narrow widths must not break the card box.

### 2. Breakpoint Containment Stability
- Grid cards must preserve containment across supported breakpoints.
- Responsive column changes must not cause content overlap, spill, or collapse.
- A layout that works only at one width is not a pass.

### 3. Shell Boundary Preservation
- Visual inspiration from a source artifact must not override the current approved shell boundaries.
- When a feature is scoped to one surface, unchanged shell regions must remain visually intact unless the approved feature explicitly includes them.
- Local surface redesign must not quietly restyle the left, top, or bottom shell.

### 4. Source-Use Discipline
- A source artifact may guide layout direction inside the approved surface.
- A source artifact must not justify importing new controls, data, or shell behavior that the approved feature did not include.
- Visual borrowing is valid only inside the approved boundary.

### 5. Readability Before Density
- Browse surfaces must stay readable under realistic content length.
- When density rises, the system should preserve hierarchy and containment before adding more visible information.
- A visually compact layout that causes clipping, overlap, or scan breakdown is a failure, not a stylistic preference.

## Classification Guidance
- Usually classify as `implementation bug` when the spec already requires stable containment or shell preservation.
- Usually classify as `spec gap` when the spec failed to define wrapping, truncation, breakpoint behavior, or shell-boundary expectations clearly enough.
- Classify as `planning gap` when the visual failure reveals that the approved feature boundary itself was wrong.
