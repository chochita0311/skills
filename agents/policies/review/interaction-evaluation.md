# Interaction Evaluation

## Purpose

- Keep reusable interaction-quality evaluation rules for state changes, transitions, and browse or read continuity.
- Preserve durable checks for interaction stability without mixing them into project-governance docs.
- Support consistent evaluation across functional and UX review work.

## Ownership

- This document owns reusable interaction-evaluation checks and cautions.
- In a consuming repo, use `docs/agents/roles/functional-evaluator.md` for the functional evaluation role contract.
- In a consuming repo, use `docs/agents/roles/ux-heuristic-evaluator.md` for the UX heuristic evaluation role contract.
- In a consuming repo, use `docs/policies/harness/execution-loop-governance.md` for fail routing and loop handling.

## Use

- Apply these rules when evaluating visible state changes, navigation continuity, or browse and read flows.
- Add new entries when the same class of interaction failure proves reusable beyond one feature.
- Promote an entry elsewhere only when it becomes broader product law rather than an evaluation asset.

## Reusable Evaluation Notes

### Transition Stability And Continuity

#### Interaction Stability

- Click-driven view changes should swap to the next state only when the destination content is ready enough to avoid visible flicker, flash, or placeholder-only intermediate states.
- Do not expose internal source paths, loading scaffolds, or temporary copy during normal screen transitions if the user can avoid seeing them.
- Prefer atomic content swaps, cached data reuse, and background prefetching over clearing the current screen first and then rebuilding it.
- Verify important browse and read flows by clicking through them in a browser and checking for brief visual flashes, unstable sticky regions, or loading-state leaks.

#### Navigation Continuity

- A user should not lose orientation during normal browse or read transitions.
- Local view changes should preserve the surrounding shell and navigation anchors unless the approved feature explicitly changes them.
- Returning from a detail surface or changing a browse mode should not feel like a reset unless the feature explicitly requires one.

#### State Exposure Discipline

- Intermediate system states should stay as invisible as reasonably possible during normal interaction.
- Temporary copy, debug-facing labels, or source-oriented state descriptions should not leak into the user-visible surface.
- If loading or recovery states are required, they should appear intentional and bounded rather than as raw implementation leakage.

### Binding, Scope, And Responsive State Ownership

#### Interaction Binding Preservation

- UI updates must not silently destroy active interaction bindings on controls that should continue working after a rerender.
- If a surface rebuild replaces buttons, links, or controls with new nodes or components, the system must preserve or rebind the intended interactions as part of the same change.
- Re-rendering markup without restoring event behavior is a blocking defect, not an acceptable implementation detail.
- Pagination, mode toggles, navigation controls, and repeated actions should be explicitly rechecked after any interactive-surface replacement strategy.

#### Scope Transition Reset Rule

- When a scope change redefines the result set, explicit reset is usually safer than carrying forward the previous search or filter state.
- If global filtering and scoped search would conflict, the interaction should clear one state before entering the other instead of leaving both implicitly active.
- Evaluators should check whether query, tag, category, collection, or similar browse states are reset or preserved intentionally rather than by accident.
- If a scope change replaces the visible result set after the user has scrolled, the destination scope should start at an intentional anchor, usually the top of the new result list.
- Carrying the previous scroll depth into a different category, collection, or result scope is usually a continuity failure because it hides the beginning of the newly selected content.

#### Navigation Context Restoration

- Direct entry into a detail route should restore enough surrounding navigation context for the user to understand where the item belongs.
- If the same detail item reached from a list expands or highlights a category, collection, or parent group, a direct URL entry should produce the same orientation state.
- Evaluators should compare list-driven entry and direct-link entry for active navigation state, expanded groups, and visible parent labels.

#### Breakpoint Control-State Compatibility

- If a responsive breakpoint hides or removes a mode switch, toggle, or similar state-changing control, the interface must also normalize into a state that remains supported without that control.
- A hidden control must not leave the user stranded in a now-invisible or no-longer-supported mode merely because URL state, previous viewport state, or persisted runtime state still points there.
- Evaluators should resize into and out of the affected breakpoint and also test direct-link entry with stateful query parameters to confirm that the visible controls and active runtime mode still match.

### Menus, Disclosures, And Affordances

#### Immediate Dropdown Dismissal

- Hover-driven dropdowns should close immediately after the user makes a selection.
- Leaving the dropdown open after selection slows recognition of the newly loaded destination state.
- Evaluators should verify both the selected result and the menu-dismiss behavior, not just the navigation target.

#### Compact Control Menu Placement

- Compact controls such as page-size or sort menus should open in a way that preserves nearby content readability rather than covering the primary browse surface unnecessarily.
- The expanded menu should feel attached to its trigger through aligned width, boundary, and placement instead of appearing as a detached floating box.
- Evaluators should test both the closed and expanded states and verify that the chosen direction, spacing, and attachment do not create avoidable overlap with cards or other active content.

#### Click-Affordance Match

- Pointer, hover, and focus affordances should appear only on the part of a surface that is actually interactive.
- If only a title, summary, or other sub-area opens a destination, the surrounding card body must not advertise clickability through pointer cursor or full-surface hover treatment.
- Evaluators should compare real click targets with visible affordances and flag any surface that still feels clickable after the interactive area has been narrowed.

#### Disclosure Direction Consistency

- A compact disclosure control should not visually imply one expansion direction while actually opening in another.
- If a menu opens downward, its cue should remain stable or reinforce downward attachment rather than flipping into an upward state on open.
- Evaluators should check both closed and expanded states and confirm that the visual cue, placement, and expanded panel all tell the same directional story.

### Repeated Controls And State Anchoring

#### Repeated Footer Action Anchoring

- Repeated footer actions such as pagination buttons or page-size changes should preserve practical click reach after each state change.
- If the result length changes after the action, the interaction should keep the footer control area anchored closely enough that the user can continue acting without re-chasing the control.
- Evaluators should test short-final-page transitions, larger page-size transitions, and repeated previous or next actions near the bottom of the viewport.

### Reading Surface Link Integrity

#### Reference Link Rendering Integrity

- Reading surfaces that render references, citations, or Markdown links must preserve usable anchors in both the body content and any generated reference panel.
- Auto-linking raw URLs must not corrupt existing Markdown links by creating nested anchors, malformed `href` values, or duplicated visible URL fragments.
- Evaluators should test notes with raw URLs, Markdown links, trailing punctuation, and generated reference sections because link-rendering failures often appear only in mixed content.

### First-State Isolation And Handoff

#### First-State Interaction Isolation

- If a landing, modal, overlay, or other first-entry surface is meant to be the active state, downstream interactive surfaces must not remain keyboard-focusable, pointer-active, or screen-reader-visible during that phase.
- Visual overlay alone is not sufficient evidence of isolation; evaluators should explicitly check `inert`, focus order, `aria-hidden`, or equivalent interaction-blocking behavior on deferred surfaces.
- A feature may still pass if downstream content remains visually mounted for continuity, but only after evaluators confirm that the inactive layer cannot steal interaction before the handoff.

#### First-State Handoff Consistency

- When shell navigation, direct URL entry, or other scope-changing interaction hands off from a first-entry state to a downstream surface, the first-entry state must be dismissed early enough that it cannot visually reappear during the same transition.
- Route interpretation, first-state visibility, and destination rendering should converge as one coherent handoff rather than exposing a frame where the old first state briefly competes with the chosen destination.
- Evaluators should test narrow and wide viewport cases, direct-link entry, and shell-driven navigation to confirm that a hidden landing or overlay does not resurface because dismissal state lags behind routing or render order.

## Classification Guidance

- Usually classify as `implementation bug` when the spec already requires stable transitions, continuity, or no-leak behavior.
- Usually classify as `spec gap` when the spec failed to define how view changes, loading behavior, or navigation continuity should work.
- Classify as `planning gap` when the interaction failure reveals a missing mode, missing flow definition, or wrong approved feature boundary.
