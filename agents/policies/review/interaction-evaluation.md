# Interaction Evaluation

## Purpose
- Keep reusable interaction-quality evaluation rules for state changes, transitions, and browse or read continuity.
- Preserve durable checks for interaction stability without mixing them into project-governance docs.
- Support consistent evaluation across functional and UX review work.

## Ownership
- This document owns reusable interaction-evaluation checks and cautions.
- Use [../../agents/functional-evaluator.md](../../agents/functional-evaluator.md) for the functional evaluation role contract.
- Use [../../agents/ux-heuristic-evaluator.md](../../agents/ux-heuristic-evaluator.md) for the UX heuristic evaluation role contract.
- Use [../project/execution-loop-governance.md](../project/execution-loop-governance.md) for fail routing and loop handling.

## Use
- Apply these rules when evaluating visible state changes, navigation continuity, or browse and read flows.
- Add new entries when the same class of interaction failure proves reusable beyond one feature.
- Promote an entry elsewhere only when it becomes broader product law rather than an evaluation asset.

## Reusable Evaluation Notes

### 1. Interaction Stability
- Click-driven view changes should swap to the next state only when the destination content is ready enough to avoid visible flicker, flash, or placeholder-only intermediate states.
- Do not expose internal source paths, loading scaffolds, or temporary copy during normal screen transitions if the user can avoid seeing them.
- Prefer atomic content swaps, cached data reuse, and background prefetching over clearing the current screen first and then rebuilding it.
- Verify important browse and read flows by clicking through them in a browser and checking for brief visual flashes, unstable sticky regions, or loading-state leaks.

### 2. Navigation Continuity
- A user should not lose orientation during normal browse or read transitions.
- Local view changes should preserve the surrounding shell and navigation anchors unless the approved feature explicitly changes them.
- Returning from a detail surface or changing a browse mode should not feel like a reset unless the feature explicitly requires one.

### 3. State Exposure Discipline
- Intermediate system states should stay as invisible as reasonably possible during normal interaction.
- Temporary copy, debug-facing labels, or source-oriented state descriptions should not leak into the user-visible surface.
- If loading or recovery states are required, they should appear intentional and bounded rather than as raw implementation leakage.

### 4. Interaction Binding Preservation
- UI updates must not silently destroy active interaction bindings on controls that should continue working after a rerender.
- If a surface rebuild replaces buttons, links, or controls with new nodes or components, the system must preserve or rebind the intended interactions as part of the same change.
- Re-rendering markup without restoring event behavior is a blocking defect, not an acceptable implementation detail.
- Pagination, mode toggles, navigation controls, and repeated actions should be explicitly rechecked after any interactive-surface replacement strategy.

## Classification Guidance
- Usually classify as `implementation bug` when the spec already requires stable transitions, continuity, or no-leak behavior.
- Usually classify as `spec gap` when the spec failed to define how view changes, loading behavior, or navigation continuity should work.
- Classify as `planning gap` when the interaction failure reveals a missing mode, missing flow definition, or wrong approved feature boundary.
