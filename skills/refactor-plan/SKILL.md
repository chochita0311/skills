name: refactor-plan
description: Plan or update structured refactoring work when the user asks to refactor, split a refactor into phases, preserve behavior while changing structure, introduce intentional semantic cleanup with explicit scope, or create a reusable refactoring tracking document. Use when a codebase needs a clear phased refactor plan, invariants, validation gates, and merge-ready checkpoints.

# Refactor Plan

Use this skill when the task is to plan refactoring work, not to immediately implement the full refactor blindly.

This skill is general-purpose. It should travel well across repositories, stacks, and languages.

## Workflow

1. Gather planning context before proposing steps.
   - Read the bundled checklist in [references/checklist.md](references/checklist.md).
   - Inspect any repository-specific guidance already present in the target codebase.
   - List existing refactor plans, architecture notes, or tracking files and inspect the ones closest in scope.
   - Anchor the plan in actual files, modules, interfaces, data contracts, and runtime behavior.

2. Classify the refactor before designing phases.
   - Mark the work as primarily `Structural`, `Behavioral`, or `Semantic`.
   - State whether the goal is behavior-preserving parity or intentional semantic change.
   - If merge safety or parity judgment is in scope, plan explicit parity-audit evidence requirements up front.
   - Separate non-goals so unrelated infrastructure churn, package churn, and semantic redesign do not get mixed casually.

3. Decide whether to extend or create a tracking document.
   - Extend an existing plan when the new work is a direct continuation of that track.
   - Create a new numbered or named plan when the work starts a distinct new track.
   - Do not overwrite historical rationale from earlier plan files; preserve continuity and add explicit handoff notes when scope moves.
   - By default, place refactor tracking files under `./docs/plans/refactoring/`.
   - If the project already uses another folder for refactor plans, follow that existing convention instead of forcing a new one.

4. Build the plan in bounded slices.
   - Define baseline compare target and invariants first.
   - Split work into steps/phases/batches with clear boundaries.
   - For each step, define goal, why the grouping is safe, representative targets, validation, and exit gate.
   - Keep risky interface, persistence, deployment, concurrency, or messaging changes late unless they are the direct objective.
   - Make each step small enough that completion can be proven, reviewed, and reverted without ambiguity.

5. Use architecture boundaries deliberately when planning semantic refactors.
   - Prefer clearer separation between entrypoints, orchestration, domain logic, and infrastructure concerns where that separation exists or is desired.
   - Keep externally visible contracts and operational behavior stable unless intentional deltas are explicitly approved.

6. Make the output immediately usable.
   - If asked to create the plan, write or update the actual tracking file.
   - Prefer `./docs/plans/refactoring/` as the default location for refactor schemes, plans, and handoff notes.
   - Prefer `./docs/plans/refactoring/logs/` as the default location for refactor logs.
   - If the project already uses a different planning folder, continue there rather than splitting refactor history across multiple locations.
   - If only asked for planning guidance, provide a concise draft using the same canonical structure without unnecessary prose.

## General Rules

- Keep behavior-preserving work clearly separate from intentional semantic redesign.
- If behavioral parity is requested, treat parity as a proof task, not an assumption.
- For exploratory planning without merge judgment, keep parity status provisional by default.
- Preserve interface, schema, config, and generated-artifact coupling awareness when types, packages, or module boundaries move.
- Include wiring or registration checks when moving framework configuration, plugins, containers, consumers, handlers, or adapters.
- Prefer targeted parity tests plus build, startup, and runtime smoke gates for touched paths rather than vague "test everything" plans.
- Call out any expected deltas in null handling, exceptions, logging, retry behavior, side effects, concurrency, or transaction shape.
- Do not mix unrelated modernization, formatting, naming churn, and semantic redesign into the same step unless the plan explicitly says that is the goal.
- Prefer evidence-first planning: if invariants, contracts, or affected paths are unclear, investigate before defining the step boundary.
- Preserve plan continuity: when a track hands work to a later track, leave a handoff snapshot instead of silently rewriting history.

## Planning Guardrails

- Do not present speculative architecture as if it were already approved.
- Do not label a step "behavior-preserving" if contracts, persistence semantics, or side effects are intentionally changing.
- Do not claim "parity preserved", "no drift", or "safe to merge" before strict comparison evidence is recorded.
- Do not hide risky deltas inside broad step names like "cleanup", "modernization", or "polish".
- Do not use phases as a vague backlog dump; each phase needs a purpose, scope boundary, and exit gate.
- Do not assume a repository needs numbered plans if it already has a better local convention.
- Do not delete prior rationale from existing plan files unless the repository explicitly treats them as disposable working notes.
- Do not create a second refactor-planning folder when the project already has one established.

## Bundled References

- Use the reusable checklist in [references/checklist.md](references/checklist.md).
- Use the plan template in [templates/plan.md](templates/plan.md).
- Use the log template in [templates/log.md](templates/log.md).
- Use the merge-check template in [templates/merge-check.md](templates/merge-check.md).

If the project already has a numbered scheme such as `REFACTOR-0001`, reuse that style. If not, adapt the same structure to the local naming convention.

## Artifact Roles

Use the skill outputs as a small coordinated document set rather than one interchangeable file type.

- Active plan:
  - the main tracking document for scope, invariants, planned steps, validation gates, and exit goals
- Refactor log:
  - the default execution record when tracked refactor work changes code, confirms a blocker, records runtime verification, or closes a handoff event
- Merge-check log:
  - a decision record used when the active question is whether a step, batch, or track is safe to merge or parity-safe against its baseline

## Canonical Output Format

Unless the repository already has a stronger mandatory format, generate plans in this exact section order:

1. `Purpose`
2. `Refactor Type`
3. `Scope`
4. `Non-Goals`
5. `Invariants`
6. `Planned Work`
7. `Validation Gates`
8. `Intentional Deltas`
9. `Risks / Open Questions`
10. `Exit Goal`

For every step inside `Planned Work`, include these exact fields:
- `Goal`
- `Why this grouping`
- `Guardrails`
- `Targets`
- `Validation`
- `Exit gate`

When work moves to a later track, add a final handoff section:
- `Handoff to Next Track`

Use this stricter structure by default. Do not omit sections just because the answers are incomplete; mark them as provisional if needed.

## Log Guidance

Write refactor logs as durable execution records, not casual notes.

- When tracked refactor execution changes code, write a step or batch log unless the repository already records the same event in an equivalent durable form.
- Do not complete refactor work silently. Completed steps, confirmed blockers, runtime verification, and merge judgments should leave a durable log record.
- Use logs to capture:
  - step completion
  - blocker discovery
  - runtime smoke results
  - merge or parity checks
  - wrap-up and handoff outcomes
- Prefer one log per meaningful event or batch.
- Keep logs factual and scoped:
  - what was attempted
  - what changed
  - what was validated
  - what remains risky
  - what comes next
- Do not mix multiple unrelated events into one log just because they happened on the same day.
- When a log is tied to a plan track, link the active tracking file near the top.
- Prefer `./docs/plans/refactoring/logs/` as the default log folder unless the project already uses a different established location.

Unless the project already has a stronger mandatory format, generate logs in one of these canonical shapes:
- Step log
- Blocker log
- Runtime smoke log
- Wrap-up or handoff log
- Merge check log

Use the shared template and adapt the optional sections to the log type instead of inventing a new structure each time.
For merge or parity judgment logs, prefer the dedicated merge-check template instead of the general log form.
Use a merge-check log when the main question is whether a specific step, batch, or track is safe to merge, parity-safe against a baseline, or still blocked by missing proof.
Do not require a merge-check log for every execution step; use it when merge safety or parity judgment is the active decision.
When baseline or parity expectations are not obvious from the project context, ask for the missing comparison target if needed; otherwise proceed with an explicit provisional assumption and record it in the merge check.

## Output Standard

Every refactor plan should make these items explicit:
- compare target or baseline
- invariants to preserve
- scope and non-goals
- step/phase boundaries
- validation gates
- intentional deltas
- residual risks or open questions

If any of those are unknown, mark them as provisional instead of pretending they are settled.

## Parity-Strict Mode

When the user prioritizes behavioral parity, this mode is mandatory.

Activation boundary:
- Use this mode when parity, no-drift, or safe-to-merge claims are explicitly requested or clearly implied.
- If the user is only exploring plan options without merge judgment, keep parity provisional and do not force strict conclusions.

Required behavior:
- Pin an explicit compare baseline (branch/commit/release target) and record an immutable reference (resolved commit SHA) when available.
- Build a source mapping of affected old-path to new-path for the full execution flow.
- Perform file-by-file and logic-unit comparison before parity conclusions (branches, predicates, mappings, and side-effect paths).
- Compare query semantics explicitly:
  - selected tables
  - join type and predicates
  - where predicates
  - group/order/limit behavior
  - null/default/fallback behavior
  - status/filter conditions
- Compare write-path semantics explicitly:
  - write targets and predicates
  - upsert/update/insert behavior
  - timestamps, actor/source, and idempotency-relevant fields
- Compare mapping/output construction explicitly:
  - field-by-field payload population
  - defaults, fallbacks, and exception behavior
  - ordering and dedupe semantics
- Compare side-effect semantics explicitly:
  - events/messages emitted
  - audit/history writes
  - cache invalidation
  - notifications
  - security/authorization outcomes
- Compare failure-mode semantics explicitly:
  - exception propagation/translation
  - retry/rollback/compensation behavior
  - transaction boundary and partial-failure behavior

Claim rules:
- If any relevant path is not audited, parity status must be `Unknown/Provisional`.
- Do not use confidence language to mask missing audit coverage.
- `Behavioral parity = Preserved` is valid only when strict audit coverage is complete, including side-effect and failure-mode coverage.
- If drift is found mid-audit, report it immediately and revise prior parity claims.
- If a previous parity-safe statement is later contradicted by audit evidence, explicitly retract and correct that statement.
