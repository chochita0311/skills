description: Use when a project already has multiple screens, artifacts, or existing UI drift and you need a concrete design planning track for BX, UI, UX consistency, phased cleanup, or design-system reconciliation. This skill creates or updates a tracked design plan rather than a durable design constitution.

# Design Plan

Use this skill when the problem is no longer "define the design system from a base artifact" and is instead "plan how to reconcile, sequence, and validate design work across an existing product."

## Use This Skill When
- Several pages or screen artifacts already exist and design consistency needs active coordination.
- BX, UI, or UX drift has appeared across screens, components, or flows.
- The design constitution exists but implementation has drifted away from it.
- A project needs phased design cleanup, rollout sequencing, or reconciliation across multiple artifacts.
- The user explicitly asks for a design plan, design consistency plan, UX consistency plan, BX plan, or phased design refactor.

## Do Not Use This Skill When
- The main task is to derive durable design law from a first artifact. Use `init-design` instead.
- The user only wants a constitution or a one-shot design baseline.
- The issue is a single isolated component polish with no broader planning need.

## Output
- Write or update a design planning track under `./docs/plans/design/` by default.
- Prefer a specific descriptive file name when the repository does not already have one:
  - `design-consistency-plan.md`
  - `bx-ux-alignment-plan.md`
  - `design-reconciliation-plan.md`
- If the repo already has an active design plan, extend it instead of creating a parallel file.

## Core Rule
- Treat this as a planning and reconciliation workflow, not as a second constitution.
- Keep durable visual law in `docs/policies/design/`.
- Use the design plan only for active sequencing, scoped batches, open design decisions, validation, and rollout tracking.

## Plan Should Include
- purpose
- baseline or audited sources
- scope
- non-goals
- invariants
- findings or drift categories
- planned work in bounded batches
- validation gates
- risks or open questions
- exit goal

## Plan Should Not Include
- a restatement of the full design constitution
- locked token tables already owned by design policy docs
- speculative redesign directions with no execution boundary
- implementation-free summaries that do not affect sequencing

## Recommended Structure
1. `Purpose`
2. `Plan Type`
3. `Baseline`
4. `Scope`
5. `Non-Goals`
6. `Invariants`
7. `Findings` or `Consistency Problems`
8. `Planned Work`
9. `Validation Gates`
10. `Risks / Open Questions`
11. `Exit Goal`
12. `Handoff to Next Track` when needed

## Planned Work Expectations
- Split work into bounded batches by screen family, pattern family, or drift category.
- For each batch include:
  - `Goal`
  - `Why this grouping`
  - `Guardrails`
  - `Targets`
  - `Validation`
  - `Exit gate`

## Validation
- Prefer side-by-side artifact review, runtime smoke checks, and constitution-alignment checks.
- State clearly whether the plan is for:
  - visual consistency
  - interaction consistency
  - information hierarchy consistency
  - brand-experience consistency
  - or a combination

## Handoff Rule
- If the outcome becomes stable design law, move it into `docs/policies/design/`.
- If the outcome remains active cleanup or rollout work, keep it in the design plan.
